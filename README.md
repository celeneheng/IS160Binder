The code starts by importing the MNIST dataset using Keras. It defines a neural network model using Keras with two densely connected layers.The input images are reshaped and normalized to be between 0 and 1. The labels are one-hot encoded.The model is trained on the training data with 5 epochs and a batch size of 128.

The first model has a training accuracy of approximately 99.19% and a validation accuracy of approximately 98.53%, while the second model achieves a test accuracy of 98.77%.
